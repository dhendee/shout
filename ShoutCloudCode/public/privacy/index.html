        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      </div>
      <p>This Privacy Policy describes how and when Schowt collects, uses, and shares your information when you use our Services. Schowt receives your information through our mobile applications, websites, notifications, and other interactions with our Services. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country you reside in or supply information from, you authorize Schowt to use your information in the United States and any other country where Schowt operates.</p>

      <h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>
      <p><b>Content, Following, and other Public Information:</b> Schowt is a content sharing platform, so all of the information you provide us is information that you choose to be made public. This includes not only the Content that you post and data provided with such Content, such as when it was posted, but the Content that you like or comment on, and other public interactions on the Services. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. When you share information or Content via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.</p>

      <p><b>Location Information:</b> You may also tell us your exact location if you choose to enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services.</p>

      <p><b>Links:</b> We may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, for example to provide relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>

      <p><b>Cookies:</b> Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. Schowt may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. If you do not want cookies from Schowt or other websites, you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies.</p>

      <p><b>Log Data:</b> Our servers automatically record information ("<strong>Log Data</strong>") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services,view videos hosted by Schowt, or interact with our email notifications. Schowt uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them.</p>

      <p><b>Third-Party Service Providers:</b> Schowt uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various sites, blogs and APIs, and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address.</p>

      <h4>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h4>
      <p><b>Your Consent:</b> We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you choose to publicly post a message.</p>

      <p><b>Service Providers:</b> We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States and abroad. We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.</p>

      <p><b>Law and Harm:</b> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Schowtâ€™s rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's, including a government's, request to disclose your information.</p>

      <p><b>Business Transfers:</b> In the event that Schowt is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.</p>

      <p><b>Non-Private or Non-Personal Information:</b> We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your posts, shares, or flags; or the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did).</p>

      </p><h4>Our Policy Towards Children</h4>
      <p>Our Services are not directed to persons under 13. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@schowt.com">support@schowt.com</a>. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's account.</p>

      <h4>Changes to this Policy</h4>
      <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at <a href="http://schowt.com/privacy">http://schowt.com/privacy</a>.
