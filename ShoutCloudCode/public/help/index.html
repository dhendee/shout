        <h4>What is Schowt?</h4>
        <p>
          Schowt is a mobile service that lets you anonymously post messages that can be seen by other nearby users. You can also share your posts to Facebook, Twitter, or Pinterest.
        </p>
        <h4>What can I use Schowt for?</h4>
        <p>
          You can use Schowt to complain (politely) about your neighbors making too much noise. Or you can use it to get help finding a lost pet. You can also use Schowt to notify people about a fun event nearby, or just to celebrate a great day.
        </p>
        <h4>How do I get started?</h4>
        <p>
          Schowt is currently available for iPhones. You can download Schowt for iOS in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/schowt">Apple App Store</a>. After installing Schowt on your device, you can begin using it immediately. You don't need to log in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: Android support is planned for a future release.
        </p>
        <h4>How often can I post messages on Schowt?</h4>
        <p>
          You can post a message on Schowt once for every point you have. Your current points are shown in the toolbar, on the left. Each time you post, your points total will go down by one. You'll find that you can post on average once per day.
        </p>
        <h4>How do I get more points?</h4>
        <p>
          Every day you load the app, you will earn a new point. You can also buy points in the App Store. View purchase options by tapping on your points total in the toolbar, on the left.
        </p>
        <h4>Is Schowt really anonymous?</h4>
        <p>
          As anonymous as we can make it. Each device you use with Schowt is uniquely identified so we can keep track of your points, but other than that we don't store any information about you. That said, people will know when a post is made close by and can determine its location within &frac14; mile. So please be careful and polite.
        </p>
        <h4>How do I share the message on Schowt to Facebook, Twitter, or Pinterest?</h4>
        <p>
          You can share posts on Schowt to Facebook, Twitter, or Pinterest by tapping the icon with three dots. Then select "Share to Facebook," "Tweet," or "Pin It." You'll need to log in to the appropriate service, but we don't store your username.
        </p>
        <h4>What do I do if my post failed to upload?</h4>
        <p>
          If your post fails to save, try refreshing by tapping on the icon in the right side of the top toolbar. If the message continues to fail, try posting it again. If that fails, try quitting the app and shutting it down manually by double-clicking the home button and tap-and-hold on the Schowt icon in the list of running apps. Then tap the red "x" to close Schowt. Finally, reload Schowt and try again.
        </p>
        <h4>How do I report an inappropriate post on Schowt?</h4>
        <p>
          If you come across an offensive post on Schowt, you can report the post by tapping the button with three dots at the bottom of the post and selecting "Report Inappropriate."
        </p>
